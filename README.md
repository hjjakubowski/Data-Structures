### Data Structures

This repository was created for the 'Data Structures' course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.  
During this course, we will complete three mini-projects.

The first project focuses on implementing various types of lists for data management.
During the project, we will implement:

- Dynamic Array
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

The second project explores different implementations of priority queues.  
We implement both a heap-based priority queue and a priority queue based on a doubly linked list.

The third project is dedicated to hash tables.  
We implement several variants of hash tables for key-value storage including:

- separate chaining
- linear probing
- version with AVL trees in buckets.
