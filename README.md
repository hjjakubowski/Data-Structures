### Data Structures

This repository was created for the 'Data Structures' course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 
During this course, we will complete three mini-projects.

The first project focuses on implementing various types of lists for data management. 
During the project, we will implement:

- Dynamic Array (Array List)
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
